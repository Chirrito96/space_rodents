## Project Overview

**Space Rodents** is an analysis and visualization platform that explores the effects of microgravity on rodent physiology during space missions. Rodents are commonly used as test subjects in space research due to their biological similarities to humans, making them vital to space biology experiments. Our platform enables users to understand and visualize key metrics and behaviors of rodents in space environments.

### Key Insights:
- Visualize how space missions affect rodent physiology.
- Analyze rodent behavior in microgravity through data-driven insights.
- Gain an understanding of the importance of rodent research in preparation for human space exploration.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.
- **Gradio**: Used to build machine learning-powered user interfaces.
- **Power BI**: For embedding interactive data visualization and analytics.
- **Vercel**: For deployment and continuous integration.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive Power BI reports on rodent experiments conducted in space.
- **Machine Learning Interface**: Using Gradio to enable users to experiment with predictive models for rodent health in space.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first design that looks great on any device.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OssFit/space_rodents.git

2. cd space_rodents

3. npm start// This will start the application on http://localhost:3000.

## NASA Space Apps Challenge

This project was developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, where participants create open-source solutions to address real-world problems using NASA’s extensive data. Our project aims to contribute to space biology research, specifically understanding the behavior and health of rodents in microgravity.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel. You can access the live version of the application here:
